# odin-recipes

This project uses a recipes website as a tutorial for building a basic website.  The recipes folder will contain the recipes, and the images folder will contain images of the dishes.

The project uses Git for version control, and VSCode as the local editor.

A repository for the website is hosted on Github.

The project was developed on a Linux virtual machine running on VirtualBox on Windows 10.
