[This](https://simontyrrell.github.io/odin-recipes) is my odin-recipes website.  It's the first website I developed having enrolled in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Website Structure

- The recipes folder contains the recipes.
- The images folder contains images of the dishes.

## Development platform

- Xubuntu VirtualBox virtual machine hosted on my Windows 10 laptop.  
- Git for version control.
- VSCode as editor.

### Publication

The repository for the website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/).
