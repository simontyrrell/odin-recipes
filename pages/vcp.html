    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease a 12-inch pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mayonnaise, ketchup, and hot sauce in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Crumble burger patties into the skillet. 
            Add onion; cook, stirring to break up patties, 
            until crumbles are browned and onion is tender, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll dough to a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface, 
            allowing dough to rest as necessary. 
            Transfer to the prepared pizza pan, building up edges.</li>
        <li>Bake crust in the preheated oven for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and spread mayonnaise mixture over crust. 
            Sprinkle with 1/2 of the cheese. 
            Top with burger mixture and remaining cheese. 
            Bake until crust is brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. 
            Top with pickles and drizzle with mustard. Top with lettuce and tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
